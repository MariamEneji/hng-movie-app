Running My Vite Project Locally

Prerequisites:

I need to have Node.js installed on my computer.
Step 1: Clone the Project

I will open my terminal/command prompt.
I'll navigate to the directory where I want to clone my project.
I'll run git clone <repository-url> to clone my project repository.
Step 2: Navigate to the Project Directory

I'll change my current directory using cd <project-directory>.
Step 3: Install Dependencies

I'll install project dependencies with npm using npm install.
Step 4: Run the Development Server

To start the development server, I'll run npm run dev.
I can access my project in a web browser at http://localhost:3000.
Step 5: Building for Production (Optional)

If I want to build for production, I can use the command npm run build.
The optimized production build will be in the dist directory.
That's it! I can now run and develop my Vite project locally.

You can use these rewritten instructions as a README.md file in your project repository to guide users on running your Vite project locally, personalized for your use.
